## 🎓 Key Takeaways

Building this portfolio taught me:

1. **Start Before You're Ready:** I built this as a beginner, and that's okay. The best way to learn is by doing.

2. **Documentation Matters:** Writing about what I'm building helps solidify my learning and creates valuable content.

3. **Iteration is Normal:** This site went through multiple revisions, and that's part of the development process.

4. **Use Available Tools:** Leveraging AI, themes, and frameworks isn't "cheating" - it's being resourceful and efficient.

5. **Learning in Public:** Sharing my journey authentically, including acknowledging AI collaboration, builds trust and shows growth mindset.
