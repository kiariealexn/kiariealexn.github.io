## 📊 Depreciation Calculator

**Status:** ✅ Live - Phase 2 Complete

**Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, GitHub Pages

**Project Overview:**
Professional web-based depreciation calculator supporting multiple accounting methods. 

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Straight-Line depreciation method
- ✅ Declining Balance method (200% & 150%)
- ✅ Responsive design 
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Educational explanations of each method

**What I Learned:**
- Complex form validation and error handling
- Professional documentation practices
- Git workflows and GitHub Pages deployment
- Solving real accounting problems with code

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. **JavaScript Number Precision:** Implemented custom rounding to ensure 2-decimal accuracy for financial calculations
2. **Edge Case Handling:** Declining balance method must stop at salvage value, requiring conditional logic
3. **User Experience:** Balanced comprehensive validation with helpful, non-intrusive error messages

**Timeline:** January 2026 (2 weeks - Phase 1 & 2)
