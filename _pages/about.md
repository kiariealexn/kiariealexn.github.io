Hi, I'm Alex Kiarie, a Nairobi-based tech enthusiast transitioning into software development.
I studied Economics at the Technical University of Kenya, but I've always been passionate about technology and cybersecurity. Over the past few years, I've been balancing my interest in tech with pursuing my CPA certification - working in roles spanning finance, IT operations, and sales, from supporting internal audits at the Kenya Revenue Authority to customer acquisition at JTL KE.

Along the way, I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner and CCNA certifications, which only deepened my interest in how systems work. But now, I'm ready to go beyond understanding technology - I want to build it.
I'm currently learning web development from the ground up, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio is my learning journal and a place to showcase the projects I'm building as I grow my skills. I'm particularly interested in how development intersects with cybersecurity and cloud technologies.
