If you'd told me a few years ago that I'd be writing code and building websites, I probably would have laughed. I was neck-deep in economics textbooks, CPA study materials, and financial audits. Yet here I am, with a portfolio site and a growing passion for software development. So, what changed?

## The Economics Graduate Who Loved Tech
I graduated from the Technical University of Kenya with a degree in Economics. On paper, I was headed for a career in finance - and for a while, that's exactly where I went. I worked on internal audits at the Kenya Revenue Authority, dove into CPA certifications, and even spent time in sales at Jamii Telecommunications Ltd.
But there was always something else pulling at me: technology.

## The Turning Point
While pursuing my CPA, I found myself more excited about the IT systems we used than the financial statements they produced. I started asking questions: How do these systems work? How are they built? What makes them secure?
That curiosity led me to get my AWS Cloud Practitioner and CCNA certifications. I thought understanding cloud infrastructure and networking would satisfy my tech itch. Instead, it made it worse - in the best way possible.
I realized I didn't just want to use technology or manage systems. I wanted to build them.

## Why Development?
The decision to learn software development wasn't about abandoning finance - it was about expanding my toolkit. Here's what drew me in:
Problem-Solving at Scale: Economics taught me to think about systems and incentives. Development lets me build solutions to problems I see every day.
The Creative Aspect: There's something deeply satisfying about writing code that actually works. It's like solving a puzzle, except you're creating the pieces as you go.
The Intersection with Cybersecurity: My interest in security isn't going anywhere. If anything, understanding how software is built makes me better equipped to think about how to secure it.
Continuous Learning: Technology moves fast, and I like that. There's always something new to learn, a better way to do things, or a problem that hasn't been solved yet.

## Starting from Zero
I'll be honest - I'm a beginner. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. This portfolio site you're reading? It's one of my first real projects, and I'm building it to learn.
But that's the point. Everyone starts somewhere, and I'd rather start now than wonder "what if" five years down the line.
<!--more-->
## What's Next?
My plan is simple: build things, break things, learn from both. I'm documenting my journey here - the wins, the struggles, the "why won't this code work" moments at 2 AM.
I'm particularly interested in exploring:
  * Web development fundamentals
  * Cloud technologies (building on my AWS knowledge)
  * Cybersecurity principles in software design
  * How finance and fintech intersect with development

If you're on a similar journey, or if you've made a career transition yourself, I'd love to hear about it. Drop me a message on LinkedIn or Twitter.
Here's to new beginnings and the courage to start from scratch.
