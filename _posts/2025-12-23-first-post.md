If you'd told me a few years ago that I'd be writing code and building websites, I probably would have laughed. I was neck-deep in economics textbooks, CPA study materials, and financial audits. Yet here I am, with a portfolio site and a growing passion for software development. So, what changed?
Welcome to my blog. I'm Alex Kiarie, someone who sees the structured logic of finance and the dynamic innovation of technology not as separate worlds, but as two essential sides of modern problem-solving.

## The Economics Graduate Who Loved Tech
I graduated from the Technical University of Kenya with a degree in Economics. On paper, I was headed for a career in finance - and for a while, that's exactly where I went. I worked on internal audits at the Kenya Revenue Authority, dove into CPA certifications, and even spent time in sales at JTL KE.
But there was always something else pulling at me: `technology`.
My path hasn't been a linear switch from one field to another. Instead, it's been a parallel build: deepening my expertise in accounting and financial systems through my CPA studies, while simultaneously expanding my technical toolkit with certifications in AWS Cloud, CCNA networking, and Ethical Hacking. This blog is where these tracks converge. It's a space for exploring how core principles from one discipline can inform and elevate practical builds in the other.

You can expect content focused on applied knowledge—turning theory into tools. This means translating financial concepts into clean, functional software, breaking down the architecture of fintech solutions, and sharing the hands-on journey of building with purpose.
A perfect example of this intersection in action is a project I've just deployed: a professional [Depreciation Calculator](https://kiariealexn.github.io/depreciation-calculator/).

## 🎯 Why This Convergence Matters
The future of finance is unequivocally tech-enabled. Whether in fintech, automated accounting, or advanced data analysis, the professionals who will lead are those fluent in both the language of business logic and the language of technical implementation.
I'm committed to building projects that bridge this gap—creating tools that solve real financial and operational challenges with modern, accessible technology.

## What's Next?
My plan is simple: build things, break things, learn from both. I'm documenting my journey here - the wins, the struggles, the "why won't this code work" moments at 2 AM.
I'm particularly interested in exploring:
  * Web development fundamentals
  * Cloud technologies (building on my AWS knowledge)
  * Cybersecurity principles in software design
  * How finance and fintech intersect with development.

This blog will document that journey—the process, the hurdles, and the insights.

If you're a finance professional curious about technology, a developer interested in the "why" behind fintech, or on a similar path of synthesis, I invite you to follow along. Let's connect and build something insightful.
