## Building My Depreciation Calculator: A Journey from Finance to Code
### How I combined my CPA studies with web development to create a practical portfolio project.

Hello! If you've been following my journey, you know I'm transitioning from a background in economics and finance into the world of software development. To bridge these two worlds, I decided to build something that speaks to both: a Depreciation Calculator.
This project wasn't just about writing code; it was about making the accounting concepts I'm studying for my CPA exam tangible and interactive.

## Why a Depreciation Calculator?

As a CPA candidate, depreciation methods (Straight-Line, Declining Balance, etc.) are fundamental. As an aspiring developer, I wanted to build a clean, useful web app. This calculator was the perfect fusion as it reinforced my finance knowledge while forcing me to apply new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to solve a real problem.

## The Collaboration: Learning with AI

I didn't build this alone. As a novice, I collaborated extensively with AI assistants, `Claude` and `DeepSeek`, to guide the process. They acted as my technical mentors, helping me:

  * Structure the project from scratch.

  * Debug JavaScript logic for accurate financial formulas.

  * Understand Git and GitHub, which was a major initial hurdle.

## The "Git" of It All: A Newbie's Hurdle

Speaking of hurdles, my biggest challenge wasn't the code—it was version control. As a GitHub novice, I found the process of commits, pushes, and branches confusing. At one point, I even encountered a cryptic error about "Git LFS" that stopped me in my tracks!
With patient guidance, I learned to navigate these waters. Figuring out how to successfully deploy the project to GitHub Pages and see it live on the web for the first time was an incredibly satisfying "aha!" moment. It transformed the project from files on my computer into a real, shareable application.

## What Does It Do?

The calculator allows you to input an asset's cost, salvage value, and useful life. With a click, it generates a year-by-year depreciation schedule using the Straight-Line method (with more methods coming soon!). It presents the data in a clear table and will soon feature charts for visualization. It’s clean, responsive, and, most importantly, accurate to accounting standards.

## What's Next?

This is just Phase 1. I'm currently working on Phase 2, which will add the Declining Balance and Sum-of-the-Years-Digits methods. Future plans include interactive charts and export functionality.

## Key Takeaway

This project taught me that the best way to learn is to build. It connected abstract coding syntax to a concrete outcome I care about. It also showed me the value of asking for help, whether from AI or the broader developer community.
